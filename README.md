## Description

This is a small project I made for fun to accompany [the Net Ninja's Udemy course on building React Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-react-firebase/)

This is a simple picture matching game that was built using typescript, React, and css. You can [try it out here](https://joshua-a-jones.github.io/react-matching-game/).

The background image was taken from [freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/tropical-island-with-treasure-chest-broken-pirate-ship-cartoon-sea-landscape-with-sail-boat-after-shipwreck-with-skull-black-sails-palm-trees-gold-coins-uninhabited-island_15709554.htm) and was created by upklyak.
